                        </section>
                <div>I've been programming for over seven years in a wide array of languages ranging from Java to Smalltalk.</div>
                <div>I did my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Pace University, graduating with honors in 2025. 
                     Throughout my undergraduate education, I took many courses focusing on game development as well as literature courses about transmedia storytelling and writing for formats such as comics.
                     It was through these courses that I was able to develop a plethora of projects using the Unity engine and C# for the web, windows, and even VR devices. 
                     In the field of Computer Science, game development was the area I was drawn to as I felt it had the most potential for creative expression.
                </div>
                <div>I’ve always been interested in storytelling, and all of the various mediums that can achieve it, and games had the element of user interactivity that distinguished it from every other medium. 
                     I believe that coding has tons of potential for creative application, and I feel this is something that p5.js can act as a gateway for.</div>
                <div>In my free time, I am an avid consumer of media, being able to hold hour long conversations about properties like DC, Star Wars, and Doctor Who. I am also a musician who enjoys writing songs.</div>
