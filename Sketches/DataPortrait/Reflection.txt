I decided to make my Spotify listening history over the course of a few days my data set to play around with. I came up with the idea to make a digital iPod with songs from the listening history.
I created playlists for each day, turned them into excel sheets, and ported them over to p5js to turn into arrays. With this, I was able to create a click wheel that cycles through each song in the array and displays it in the "Now Playing" text.
My plan was to have the sketch be actually able to play the songs from my playlist like a real iPod would. Unfortunately, I am limited by the web security of both Spotify and YouTube, and without the use of external APIs that I would much rather just not go through the effort of fiddling with, this feature became scrapped in favor of just a few songs from the top artists of the two playlists.
I decided to just make arrays of ~12 songs and their cover arts to display as they were being played, adding functionality to the buttons to add play/pause, rewind, and skip. I also wanted to play around with p5js's FFT tool to create a live visual spectogram of the songs as they were playing.
