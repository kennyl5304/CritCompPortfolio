Partners: Zainab Vajihi and Anna Zimmer

OC Story (Me): I picture this creature as . It has a vaguely humanoid head with a cracked porcelian torso and a rattlesnake tail instead of legs.

The head portion was inspired by the cover art of Harlan Ellison's I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream, as well as King Crimson's In the Court of the Crimson King.
I didn't want to do a generic human torso, so I decided to get freaky and decided to model it after a certain image from the Hell panel of The Garden of Earthly Delights painting.
The legs are a snake.


New OC Story: This is a bat-harpy hybrid sent to our dimension, where it suffered a grevious accident. It ended up merging with my browser history. This resulted in it's legs being replaced by an amalgamation of wires, the concept of music, and my enjoyment of spices.

I decided to make the corpse a mix of my head, Anna's torso, and Zainab's legs. I did the legs first, and I figured I could add interactivity to it by having the cassette be playable, which could also play into the head having a megaphone-like shape on the side.

I don't know what else to say, it's just a lot of bezier curves.
Eventually, I got tired and used ChatGPT to make the hands and abs because god only knows what I would do to not use bezier curves again
